Overview This project is part of the semester capstone for Statistics 810 at Michigan State University. The goal is to develop an advanced recommendation system for an e-commerce platform using statistical methods and machine learning techniques.

By leveraging a comprehensive dataset containing user interactions, such as product views, carts, and purchases, the recommendation engine will provide personalized product suggestions based on user behavior patterns. This project demonstrates the application of advanced statistical concepts in a real-world setting.

Project Objectives Data Preprocessing: Clean, standardize, and enrich user interaction data. Recommendation Model Development: Implement statistical models such as Bayesian analysis, collaborative filtering, and multivariate statistics. Feature Engineering: Create additional features based on time, session behavior, and user preferences. Evaluation Metrics: Measure the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like Precision@K, Mean Average Precision (MAP), and more. Dashboard Implementation: Build an interactive dashboard (R Shiny or Dash) to visualize recommendations and key metrics.
